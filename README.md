## 🔥 Core Features

- **🚪 Join via Code**  
  Got an invite? Just enter the party code, verify your email, and step into the event. It’s seamless, smart, and secure.

- **🧠 Smart Gatekeeping**  
  Only verified guests with completed RSVPs and payments are granted entry. If you haven’t paid, get redirected to the payment flow — no gatecrashing here.

- **🎶 AI DJ Autoplay**  
  Our spotlight feature. The AI DJ curates music in real-time based on user votes and vibes — because every party deserves a flawless soundtrack.

- **📍 Discover Nearby Parties**  
  Automatically detect and display open, happening parties near your location. Explore, preview, and join — the city is your dance floor.

- **🎤 Real-Time Interaction**  
  Live chat, vote on tracks, and engage with the party crowd in real time. It's more than an event — it's a connected experience.
